            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to John, bishop of Alexandria the
               less.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during episcopacy, from the 6th book the
               154th letter.</head>
            <p> The devout subdeacons of your church have made a complaint to the apostolic see,
               alleging that an old . custom prevails in the holy church of the Alexandrines, which
               allows their order freedom from the obligation <pb n="99"/> of serving what are
               called 'weeks' in your venerated bishop's house. And we considered the statement in
               no way surprising if it is absolutely true, since in other holy churches also an
               exactly similar provision exists upon this point. Such matters are generally
               regulated in accordance with the customs of the holy churches, and the same model
               does not prevail in all of them. Seeing then that they both allege the custom in
               defence, and procure the things required to satisfy their necessities by worldly
               occupations owing to not receiving sustenance, your love of God should acquiesce in
               all these things, and not disturb that which is the custom by any innovation, unless
               perhaps some relief be given them as a counterpoise to the loss that falls upon them.
               That a man ought not to serve at his own charges Paul also who had Christ speaking in
               him enacted: and to this he further added a saying that resembles it, I mean that a
               man who devotes himself to the altar should be supported by the altar; and hence he
               gives the same decision in parallel cases also, and teaches that a man who is engaged
               in any work should also receive the means of life out of the very same business in
               which he is engaged. Therefore let the injunction also that has been laid upon them
               be removed, and the cells of their poverty opened, and the harsh acts that have been
               done obliterated by means of mildness in all things. </p>
