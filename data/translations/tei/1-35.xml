            <p> When I had read the letter of your love of God, I was desirous of carrying out what
               you ask and begging Jesus, who is God, to bestow the ordination of a deacon upon the
               devout brother John through my sinful and unworthy hand. But I was greatly opposed in
               this and my readiness hindered by the strictness of the canons, which do not on any
               other condition allow a man who has been afflicted with the yoke of slavery to enter
               the sacred clergy unless he has received manumission and removed from him the bond of
               slavery. This principle was in fact observed by Peter who is among the saints, the
               bishop from Iberia, a man who in all things acted in accordance with the judgments of
               God. When father Timothy, an inmate of what is called the convent of Majuma, had been
               approved for admission to the presbyterate, he would not on any other condition allow
               him to receive ordination, unless those who were thought to be his masters had first
               bestowed freedom upon him: and then the God-loving presbyter father Theodore went
               with him and had the legal forms of manumission carried out in the church called that
               of Anthedon. For the monastery that is being built by your religiousness, and by help
               from God is on the <pb n="103"/> point of being finished, we have sent you a very
               small present: which please receive contentedly: since the holy church here, having
               been laden with many debts by him who was ejected, does not allow me to show
               munificence or liberality even in urgent matters. Our common Christ-loving brother
               the lord Genesius we received with joy, and we offered him all that was in our power,
               seeing he is a man who deserves any trouble or effort. </p>
