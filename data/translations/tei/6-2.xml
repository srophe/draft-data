               141st letter.</head>
            <p> Our Christ-loving brothers the lord Menas and Isidore informed us that some of the
               readers, moved <pb n="364"/> by divine zeal, recoiled from communion with that wicked
               man, and he laid upon them, as he thought, a ban of excommunication; and that it is
               necessary for this to be removed by us. For my part I was surprised if they
               considered a ban laid upon them by a man repudiated for his faith to be a ban at all.
               Indeed the holy Cyril also in writing to Nestorius says this; "Those who spoke
               against you on account of the faith and have been separated by you are in communion
               with us. For it is not right that such men should be injured by your sentences." If
               therefore it is on account of the orthodox faith only, and not for any other sin,
               that these too have received such a ban and have seceded from him, they are released.
               How could men who, as we said before, were never even placed under a ban at the
               beginning be under a ban? </p>
