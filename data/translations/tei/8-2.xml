               372nd letter.</head>
            <p> In this one letter I make answer to all those written at different times by your
               sanctity. <add><emph>And after other things.</emph></add> As to the case of the man
               whose genital members have been cut off, you are not right in saying that the fact
               that his name is not mentioned in the transactions against the impious Julian is
               enough to secure acquittal in our eyes. In fact, if a time of inquiry come, we shall
               certainly insist upon saying why such a count was drawn up. But this principle must
               be observed, that according to the provisions of the canon this shall be a great
               defence for him, that he in truth suffered this at the hands of physicians, by reason
               of some infirmity that had arisen in him, and he was not himself his own destroyer:
               for this is what falls under accusation and the canonical punishment. If therefore
               this appear to be so, out of benevolence place him among the clergy: you will not be
               in any way whatever relaxing the ordinances of the church. Julian of the hateful name
               was deprived for other reasons greater than these: and this count was added to those
               by way of addition: and, even if it is not true, it cannot benefit him in any way.
               Since you <pb n="395"/> have written to us about the gentle Dorotheus, it seems you
               have forgotten the points on which he caused us just vexation, which I made known to
               your love of God in another letter: and for your perfect knowledge I have thought
               good to insert a copy of that in this letter. </p>
