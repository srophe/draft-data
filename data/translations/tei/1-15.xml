               letter.</head>
            <p> That the presumptuous deeds of the impious Jews are beyond all forgiveness, and such
               as to stir and excite any soul to just wrath, even one that is not easily roused, if
               only it has been initiated in the doctrines of piety, is plain and manifest. But that
               those who like you are lovers of God and at the same time intelligent persons ought
               to handle such things in a wise way you have already shown in your epistles, the
               epistles to us and to the glorious patrician and lieutenant of the general of the
               East excellent in all good qualities, your uncle." Hence also we met together, and
               discussed the whole matter in conjunction, and endeavoured as far as possible to
               remove beforehand and prevent the evils that were about to spring up, and we set down
               what as the outcome of our deliberations appeared to us to be expedient and made this
               known to your sanctity. The indication given by their excellencies and by us who
               discussed the matter in common with them is therefore complete: but it will be a
               matter for your consideration to arrange the action to be taken on a proper footing.
               No punishment is severe enough for the arrogance of the Jews: but still men who stand
               at the head of the teaching of <pb n="61"/> piety ought not to look at what they
               ought to suffer, but at what we ought to refrain from doing. This I say, not in order
               that we may take no account of the divine laws, but that, while singing with David,
               "I have hated them that hate thee, Lord, and against thine enemies have I been
               wroth," we may also have in our mind at the same time the commandment of Moses that
               says, "Fathers shall not die for children, neither shall children die for fathers:
               every man shall die in his own sin," and not as is said by one of the wise men
               without, "The thing that so-and-so is so-and-so is not." </p>
