            <p> Even in the case of things that are acknowledged and manifest we are not justified
               either by the form of human laws or by the ordinances of the Holy Spirit in judging
               on the statement of one side. Wherefore neither did we consent to agree to the things
               that were written by your devoutness; not because we do not believe you, but to
               preserve the appearance that befits those who have been entrusted with the task of
               judging such matters. The right and proper course would have been for your love of
               God to come as far as here: and then we would have summoned the other side also to
               come to us, and the truth would have been determined. Or, if they remained away and
               did not come when summoned, then the provisions laid down in the laws regarding those
               who remain away would have been plain and would have followed upon the act. For our
               own desire is not to leave the matter unheeded and unsettled. If the saintly Isidore,
               bishop of <pb n="53"/> the city of the men of Chalcis, had been present, we would
               have yielded to him the duty of giving judgment concerning places and persons in his
               jurisdiction. But, as he is absent, it is therefore absolutely necessary that we
               should ourselves, as I have said, lay down a just conclusion of the questions that
               have been stirred. </p>
