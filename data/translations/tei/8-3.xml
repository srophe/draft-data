            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Aurelius the scholastic.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during episcopacy, from the 7th book the
               376th, 378th letter.</head>
            <p> The fact that your wisdom has been pleased to show a kind disposition towards those
               who are distressed by any vexation is good and of great profit. But for those who
               like my meanness are entrusted with the government of rational souls it is not a safe
               thing to walk contrary to the laws of the Spirit, and by granting indulgence do
               violence to what those approve. By doing such things we shall without our own
               knowledge be giving those that are under a superior liberty to sin, so that we shall
               henceforth be unable to cut off others also who neglect church discipline, by reason
               of the fact that we ourselves have already undermined this. Therefore with regard to
               the devout Thomas, if on account of some infirmity <pb n="396"/> his genital members
               have been removed by the skill of physicians, whether cut by the knife or burnt by
               drugs, he has under the canons liberty to minister, and there is no difficulty as to
               his performing priestly functions, and standing before God's altar "with open face"
               as the Apostle says. But, if he presumptuously mutilated himself, we will not put
               force upon the determination of the canons concerning him, and give occasion for
               blame against us to those who are eagerly and malignantly observing what we do. It
               may in fact happen that we cannot do all that we wish, unless it be by setting at
               naught the offence caused to many, and wounding "the weak conscience" of our
               brethren, as it is written." If it were not so know well that I too inasmuch as I am
               clad in bodily weakness am much inclined to benevolence. However, since I am "bought
               with a price," with the blood I mean of the great God and our Saviour Christ, I
               coerce my will according to His laws and check the unrestrained impulse. These things
               I have written to the saintly Cassian also the bishop of your resplendent metropolis:
               for I think I heard from his love of God that it was rather on account of an
               infirmity and under the skill of physicians that the aforesaid man was mutilated. </p>
