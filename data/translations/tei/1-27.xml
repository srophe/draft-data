            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Musonius and Alexander
               <foreign>vindices</foreign> of Anazarba.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during episcopacy, from the 5th book the 74th
               letter.</head>
            <p> It would have been best if you had both come to us and also gladdened our eyes by
               the bodily sight of you, and by this sight comforted me more. But, since you have
               public! business on your hands, and are thereby prevented from so doing, I support
               the sorrow thus caused by feeding on the spiritual sight only, and so lighten the
               loss. Wherefore also, as a token of undivided affection towards you, I have composed
               this one letter to both of you: in which I make known to <pb n="88"/> you that the
               whole synod of the God-loving bishops of the East is united in the right doctrines
               and anathematizes all the heresies: among which are included those who divide our one
               Lord and God Jesus Christ after the union into a duality of natures, and the vain
               concourse of those who assembled at Chalcedon, the stronghold of this evil heresy,
               and the impious Tome of Leo (if one called him a cleaver of peace, the expression
               would be a fitting one). These things having thus passed in order (to speak with the
               permission of God), we have now drawn up a synodal letter addressed to the God-loving
               archbishop of the city of the Alexandrines John, inviting him to unanimity and pure
               communion. And we will write epistles in the same way to the others also, keeping
               everywhere to the royal road, and not turning aside to the right or to the left,"
               guided as we are by the great love of Him who is the guide and leader along this
               road. Concerning the faith and communion with the others, as far as it was possible
               to give information in a letter, let this much suffice. If we ever meet together, you
               will know everything in greater detail and with greater clearness from actual
               experience. As to Martyrius the poet, whom you made the occasion of the letter, I
               wish you to know that he is a trouble to me, and a nuisance. Indeed in the case of
               the others also who follow the same profession, and were enrolled in the holy clergy
               of the church that is with us, I have <pb n="89"/> debarred them from practising such
               poetry: and am taking much trouble to sever this theatrical pursuit from
               ecclesiastical gravity and modesty, a pursuit that is the mother of laxity, and is
               also capable of causing youthful souls to relax and casting them into the mire of
               fornication, and carrying them away to bestial passions. But because of his
               repentance I rejoice with him, and because of the fact that he is a lover of the
               orthodox faith: especially since you who are careful scrutinizers bear witness in his
               favour. Let him therefore stay where he is, and not desire to return to this city. It
               is not possible for him to do so in my judgment: not from anger against him (far be
               it!), but because of the evil pursuit and the desire of avoiding the aforesaid
               injury. </p>
