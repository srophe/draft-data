            <p> That they who preside over Christ's rational flocks must look in front as much as
               they can, and must lead the sheep to a "place of grass," and pasture them by "the
               waters of stillness," and must watch lest anywhere any hurtful root and muddy
               perturbed drink corrupt the healthy conscience of those that are fed is already known
               to your love of God also. How is it therefore that those in Isauria and in the other
               provinces are very justly blaming you for having incautiously received Indacus, who
               presides over Corycus, when he has not agreed in confessing the same faith as we, nor
               acquiesced in the common resolutions of the whole holy Synod of the God-loving
               bishops in the East First, such a man ought not to have been received to communion
               without the judgment of the apostolic see: and, even if by reason of the pressure of
               the days of the saving Passion and of the Resurrection it had been right for him to
               be received, the rule as to the lawful mode of reception ought on no account to have
               been neglected. This is that all who hold to the same communion should think and say
               the same things. Hasten accordingly to bring the matter that you have neglected to
               correction: for you see that, if for a little <pb n="319"/> moment we close the eye
               of watchfulness, we kindle by this small spark a great flame of separation. But the
               course of healing is not difficult for you. In fact we hear that the whole honourable
               clergy of the holy church of God in Corycus have already with one accord removed the
               offences by a certain written renunciation and anathema, and that they readily hold
               to the orthodox faith and confession. Or, if you like, only make him satisfy the
               proper requirements and come according to custom to greet us, and leave the course of
               cure to us and to God. For we are able to bring him near to us by healing words. "Is
               there no balm in Gilead?" as Jeremiah says, or is it troubled by absence of
               physicians? </p>
