            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Julian the presbyter and archimandrite
               of the monastery of the blessed Bassus.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during banishment, from the 5th book the 52nd
               letter.</head>
            <p> Those who loyally follow the ascetic and solitary life grow rich in the spirit of
               understanding, and from it learn the paths of right action. Wherefore also the sacred
               text of Proverbs says, "The thoughts of an understanding man are ways of life": and
               again "Let the heart of a man think just things, in order that his steps may be
               directed by the Lord." Sharing in this instruction therefore and being guided by the
               divine Spirit, your religiousness also has not treated church order with contempt:
               but, when the holy monastery of the blessed Bassus, in which you have been appointed
               to be governor, was lacking in the needful provision for the ministry of priests and
               deacons, you properly resolved to inform me of this by a letter from you, and from me
               to obtain a solution of the doubt. Know therefore that in times of persecution anyone
               soever of the God-loving bishops who is of the same confession and the same communion
               with us in everything may properly supply the need of any among the orthodox who is
               in need. On this principle I have written to <pb n="179"/> the saintly Sergius bishop
               of Cyrrhus, and to the saintly Marion bishop of the fortress called Sura to satisfy
               your need: and under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to apply their sacred hand,
               and impart to those that are in need the gift that was given them from above, about
               which Jesus Himself the giver of the Spirit cries in the Gospels, "Freely ye have
               received freely give." </p>
