            <p> See! overcome by the fervour and purity of your gracious father's faith we have sent
               you the communion or oblation, as seemed to you to be desirable: because, while one
               and the same faith prevails in the holy churches in the East and those in Egypt, one
               must reckon the communion also to be one and of the same value, since priests,
               whatever they be in their <pb n="232"/> seals, one made of lead and the other of
               gold, bear one impress without any difference whatever, it of necessity follows that
               the wax sealed by them will bear the same signet and seal, a man who has not seen
               being unable to discern from the wax which stamp was made by the gold and which by
               the lead, so also in the case of priests, so long as they hold one and the same
               orthodox faith, and consummate a baptism, it may be, or the bloodless sacrifice, it
               is impossible to discern in which case the consecration or consummation was performed
               by the man who is golden or pure in his character, and in which by the man who by
               reason of the faultiness of his character resembles lead. For the operation and grace
               of the sound faith which consummated both of them is one: but let no one look at the
               greater and less arising from the character of those who officiated. However, as I
               said, having been overcome by the abundance of fervent love which you have towards
               Christ, we have done what was commanded by you. </p>
