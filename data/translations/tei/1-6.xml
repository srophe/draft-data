            <p> A wicked and unlawful action, one that conflicts with the laws of the catholic and
               apostolic church, has come to our ears. We hear that some of the inhabitants of the
               hamlet of Minidus and Uaris have presumed to sail westwards, and to receive an
               unhallowed ordination from those who hold the opinions of Nestorius and cut our one
               Lord and God Jesus Christ into a duality of natures after the ineffable union, an
               ordination which is invalid not in one way only but in many, and is reckoned as if it
               had never taken place: since, even if those who laid the presumptuous hand upon these
               men had <pb n="39"/> been orthodox, they ought not to have ordained in another parish
               or rather in one outside their boundary, in violation of discipline; and that while
               we by the grace of God are not charged with any heresy. This the holy canons plainly
               declare both in intention and in words. Therefore let your love of God make the
               purport of the sacred canons known to all in the neighbourhood of their parish, and
               proclaim them stripped of all the honour and rank of the priesthood and diaconate,
               and prohibit those who are in communion with us or rather with the right faith from
               associating with these men, that they may not communicate in the impiety, and call
               down upon themselves the wrath from God. </p>
