            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Simeon archimandrite of the great
               monastery.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during episcopacy, from the 3rd book the 35th
               letter.</head>
            <p> A report has reached us that your religiousness in the pursuit of quietude and the
               desire of remaining constantly in prayer and holding intercourse with God wishes to
               neglect the rational flock of brethren that <pb n="372"/> has been entrusted to you
               by our God and Saviour Jesus Christ, and that your mind is not much set upon the
               charge of them: but that for this reason you are desirous of nominating an
               administrator of the government of the monastery. When we heard this, we were
               astonished: and we did not, and still even now do not think it true: for this is
               alien to your perfection. You know well the apostolic statute that says, "Let every
               man wherein he was called therein abide," and that "we were bought with a price," and
               that we must with all our might fulfil the will of the Lord who bought us the
               captives with His own blood. But what is God's will, except that a man seek not his
               own profit, but his neighbour's? That the retention of the charge of the rational
               sheep who have been committed ta you brings you nearer to God than quietude our Lord
               and Saviour is witness, who in the Gospels said thrice to Peter, "Peter, lovest thou
               me?", and said that this is the token of love towards Him, "Feed my sheep" and "Feed
               my lambs." Therefore retain the spiritual headship with all devotion, and do not,
               while you are on a path that is higher than all paths, turn your mind to another
               which cannot make God so near to you: I forbear to say that it actually grieves His
               Holy Spirit. The allegation that you have also cut yourself off from the sacred
               ministry I am ashamed even to write. It was this especially which made me not think
               the statements true: so that, even if some <pb n="373"/> verbal bond or oaths have
               been put forward by your sanctity without consideration, we reckon this as a thing
               that is not right. Wherefore we release you from such a ban, if we ought to call this
               a ban at all, and we also urge you to preside over your flock entirely, not with half
               your mind, and to officiate at the bloodless sacrifice. </p>
