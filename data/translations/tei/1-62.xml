            <p>[...] And it seems to me that it was owing to this moderation of character and
               humility of mind that the God-inspired scripture in Omissions named Moses "the man of
               God," the words of the context being as follows: "And Moses, the man of God. And his
               sons were called to the observance of Levi." As to your saying, "We were afraid on
               account of the present <pb n="194"/> time of confusion and persecution, lest we and
               the places in which we live should lack bishops to ordain," as far as the ordination
               of a presbyter or of a male deacon, by whom the bloodless sacrifice is of necessity
               performed, is concerned, this plea would have been good. But in the case of a female
               deaconess, especially in monasteries, ordination is received not so much for the sake
               of the requirements of the mysteries, but for the sake of honour only (for the
               deaconesses in the cities are in the habit of ministering to the divine laver of
               regeneration in the case of females who are baptized). These things I have been
               compelled to repeat owing to my wish and prayer that in accordance with your high and
               praiseworthy character you may do everything in a lawful manner and, as it is written
               in Proverbs and in the Apostle, "provide things honest not only before the Lord but
               also before men," so that, in accordance with the testimony of our God and Saviour
               Jesus, "your light may shine before men" and "they may glorify your Father in
               heaven," and we ourselves may justly boast of you. And, now that these words have
               been thus spoken, we pray that God may grant a good ending to the things which have
               once in whatever way been done by you, and may cover them with the abundance of His
               graciousness. </p>
