            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Dionysius bishop of Tarsus.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during episcopacy, from the 2nd book the 4th
               letter.</head>
            <p> How I behaved with all attention and respect towards you when you came here it is
               not mine to say, but it belongs to you who had the experience to declare this, if
               need demand. Of this also I think your religiousness is not unaware, that of your own
               accord and without pressure from anyone you confessed everything that ts required for
               a confession of the orthodox faith and a renunciation of the offences that have
               divided the unity of God's holy churches, and ratified it in writing and in a letter.
               How is it then that you have treated things thus done with piety and of your own
               accord as nothing and do not keep them "with all observance," as it is written," but
               admit to the ministry men who do not share your belief, and by the expressions which
               you carelessly and lightly utter to these show that you entered into union with the
               cause of piety rather because you gave way before the time than because you
               deliberately chose what was right? Perhaps it is time for me to say <pb n="261"/> to
               you the words of the Apostle also, I mean, "Ye have not yet withstood unto blood in
               the combat against sin, and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you
               as unto sons." I shall in fact be very much ashamed, and hide myself, if we, whose
               duty it is to see "the Lord's glory with open face" and with boldness and after the
               manner of apostles, have the veil of fear and of respect of persons laid upon our
               hearts. Therefore let that which has been neglected receive the required correction
               and care. If the deed that has been done had been a case of rejecting my meanness, I
               would perhaps have overlooked it: but, if it is a case of insulting and contemning
               the orthodox faith, it is by no means a course free from danger for us to keep
               silence in this matter, if we have any regard for the eternal torture that is
               threatened. For the holy Basil also in writing to a certain Urbicius a monk speaks as
               follows: [Here follows the citation given on p. 259]. </p>
