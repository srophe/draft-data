            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to the monastery at Tagais.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during episcopacy, from the 4th book the
               248th letter.</head>
            <p> When we asked the God-loving presbyter and archimandrite Neon how your honourable
               cloister is faring and what its condition is (if one were to call that cloister a
               dwelling-place of the orthodox faith the expression would be appropriate), he told me
               that some among you out of fervent zeal are divided in a matter of names, and are
               passing to questions outside the <pb n="284"/> boundaries. But for my part I wish to
               remind you, who are disciples and hearers of Stephen who is among the saints, that
               the royal road both of the faith and of the active virtues is in danger not only from
               things that lie on the left side, but also much more from things that lie on the
               right and are not recognised, and from principles and causes that appear just and are
               able to deceive. You remember that, when the man remembered for sanctity made a union
               with the holy fathers in Palestine and in Alexandria, he found certain men to be
               deceived by considerations that lay rather on the right side, and to be passing to
               scruples self-created and uncanonical, of which you have a clearer knowledge: and
               being moved with zeal he inquired into the affair, and subjected it to very careful
               examination: and the <foreign>diataxeis</foreign> or commands of the fathers who at
               various times fed the churches were scrutinized, and the truth was made manifest and
               judgment given in its favour by everyone, and it was decided to be right. I also when
               I came here found certain men saying that converts from the evil Chalcedonian faith
               to the orthodox faith ought to be re-baptized, on the ground that the holy bishops
               who met at Laodicea and effected the deprivation of Flavian of evil name call those
               who confess two natures after the union Paulianists: and on the ground that Julius
               also, who was bishop of the city of the Romans, so termed <pb n="285"/> them, as they
               said, in his letter to Dionysius the bishop of Corinth: and I had a discussion with
               them, insomuch that I cited a certain enactment and showed that such must not be
               re-baptized, nor yet be re-anointed. Concerning names also, we must distinguish
               between times and look into them, and consider what ought to be required in the case
               of general unions, and not be confused by chance occurrences and mingle things that
               are not to be mingled, and excite disturbances against ourselves, and give others
               also, as is written, turbid filth to drink. I should have wished to deal with these
               matters in this letter also: but, since various things have been written by me in
               epistles to different men upon this same subject, I have now made <foreign>isa</foreign> or copies of
               these compositions, and have given them to the God-loving presbyter Neon, in order
               that they may be read to the God-loving intelligence and devoutness of your sacred
               company and spiritual fellowship: and I am well assured that you will place them in
               the ears of your hearts, and will write them on the tablets of the inner man, and
               will be delivered from disturbance, and with all readiness will make prayers on
               behalf of us, who are daily incurring dangers for the sake of the sound word of
               faith, and are able to say with Paul, "I swear by my boast of you, my brethren, which
               I have in Christ Jesus, that I die daily," it being understood that the Apostle
               endured <pb n="286"/> such things as a test of his virtue, while we are chastised as
               a recompense for our sins, seeing that we have nothing else to set to the credit
               account, except that we show boldness on behalf of the orthodox faith. </p>
