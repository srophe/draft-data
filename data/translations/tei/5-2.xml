               323rd letter.</head>
            <p> We were surprised when your sanctity's letter came before us, by which we learned
               that Gennadius the devout presbyter of the village called Minidus had any doubt
               whether those who have received and undergone the spurious ordination, and have
               purged themselves of these dregs by petitions of confession which they presented to
               you, and have once put off by a written legal renunciation the strange and foreign
               clothing in which they thought themselves to have been clothed by the heretics, ought
               to return to their former grade in the ministry. Therefore they must show this in
               deed by returning to the former grade, and in it performing their sacred
               ministrations, if we are not sinning in using this same expression, and mentioning
               "the <pb n="283"/> former," as if there were a second: whereas, since the second has
               no validity and is unknown to God, it is more fitting to say that they ought to
               minister in the true and only grade, which they have legally received, there being no
               other at all. For no one who has been legally ordained a deacon maybe shall be able
               to think of himself that he is a presbyter, whether by fraud or by some disowned and
               illegal hand. Therefore as I said, the devout Gennadius must know clearly that it is
               by deeds that they ought to unite to themselves those who have cast from them in
               writing the strange and accursed laying on of a heretical hand, if "the kingdom of
               God is not in word but in power," and not he that says "Lord, Lord!" but he that does
               the will of the heavenly Father enters into the kingdom of heaven. </p>
