            <p> Time has, it seems, brought a new thing, I mean a military force demanding as if it
               were part of its pay that ordination be conferred by high-priests upon certain
               persons; for such is the unreasonable treatment which the God-loving bishop of
               Pompeiupolis has informed the apostolic see that he has received; and he says that
               soldiers with their swords held above his head almost threatened to take his head
               off, unless he laid his hand on the head of such-and-such a man. This illegal act
               therefore must by all means be annulled, and be considered as if it had never been
               done. For it is known to everyone that, where there is fear and a threat of death,
               and anything akin to these, and any of the passions that are created by the devil,
               there the descent of the Holy Spirit is assuredly prevented. I forbear to mention
               that as a result of this a very bad precedent will also be laid upon the churches,
               and we shall be required henceforth to perform solemn functions after the manner of
               tyrants, unless what has been wrongfully done remains void, as is in fact demanded by
               law. </p>
