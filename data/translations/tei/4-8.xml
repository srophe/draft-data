            <p> To the holy church of God in Antioch, the devout clergymen and those that are among
               the people, Severus greeting in the Lord. Neither at an earlier time when I left your
               Christ-loving city did you omit——. <add><emph>And after other things.</emph></add>
               And to others again, showing how great are the benefits of sufferings for Christ's
               sake, he wrote in an epistle, "Unto you it was given not only to believe on Christ,
               but also to suffer for His sake," calling it a gift given by God that they should
               suffer in the cause of piety. Fitly therefore and as beseems your intelligence and
               the earnestness of your character you are searching and inquiring both as to the
               exact nature of the right faith, and as to the way to observe this with carefulness.
               For a man to be polluted by the communion of heretics ruins all the labours and <pb
                  n="269"/> toils even of the solitary life, and leads to hell and final
               destruction: from which the divine John the Evangelist also tried to hinder men,
               writing thus: [Here follows the citation given on p. 263] The God-clad Basil too, the
               great doctor of the church, wrote in an epistle to a certain monk named Urbicius,
               saying: [Here follows the citation given on p. 259] In the letter to count Terence
               also he speaks thus: "But, even if a man come from heaven itself, but is not in
               accord with the sound word of faith, I cannot reckon him a communicator in the
               sacraments." And in writing to the same Terence's daughters who were deaconesses he
               repeats the same things in a terrifying form, because the Arians and Fighters against
               the Spirit were disturbing the churches of God and were surging against them
               tyrannically: "But they who speak of either the Son or the Spirit as a creature, or
               reduce Him in any way to a subsidiary and servile office, are far from the truth:
               whose communion one should shun and from whose words one should turn away as being
               destructive of souls." And to Patrophilus the bishop he wrote thus: "If these things
               seem to you a fit subject for grief, impute the separation to those who were the
               cause. But, if you judge them indifferent, pardon us when we do not consent to be of
               the leaven of those who teach other things." Gregory also the Theologian wrote thus
               about the Arians who were in power at that time, as <pb n="270"/> I said, and
               compelled the orthodox to communicate with them against their will: "Having made this
               one charge only, that they did not assent to the impiety and were not polluted by the
               communion; which we shun as serpent's poison, that does not hurt the body but
               blackens the depths of the soul." Let no one therefore cause you to depart from that
               which is right. For "in a very little while He that cometh will come and will not
               tarry": and "He will render to every man according to his deeds." For it is in very
               truth "a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." </p>
