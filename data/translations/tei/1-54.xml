            <p> [...] in truth that the mouth should be silent which never grows weary and seems as
               if it had been set apart for prayers, the mouth which in very deed says "I will bless
               the Lord at all times," and at all times circulates His praises. You did well and
               conferred a great service upon us by relating in the course of your letter how you
               celebrated the memories of the holy fathers, and which of you have departed to God,
               one among whom is the religious presbyter Patrick. We are much profited <pb n="163"/>
               when we learn the names of these in order that we may remember them in our prayers,
               and as far as possible, cast from us the weariness that dominates us, and prepare
               ourselves for the final departure from this world. As to the events that have
               happened in the East, and the way in which the believers in Antioch have girded
               themselves for a second and third contest, as if they had never been tried by any
               tribulation, it is superfluous for us to write to you, since these are things which
               you learn also from report. Only we ask you to keep those who are thus combating in
               more earnest remembrance, and to ask that endurance may be granted them all by God.
               In trials which are so unendurable it is in fact impossible to be steadfast without
               help from that source. Wherefore Jeremiah also said to God over all, "Lord, the
               endurance of Israel! Thou savest in the time of evils." But I beg your holinesses to
               grant a place among those who are remembered by you over the rational sacrifice and
               have already gone to God to Eustochius of God-loving memory, deacon of the holy
               church in Alexandria, who has now put off his life in much zeal for the orthodox
               faith, with all accuracy and in knowledge as the divine Apostle says, so that he
               often longed for the bodily sight of your love of God also. Of him the religious
               presbyter Philip also made trial to a moderate extent. </p>
