            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Solon, bishop of Seleucia in
               Isauria.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">from those during episcopacy, from the 4th book the
               338th letter.</head>
            <p> Paul the bishop of Olba, as may be inferred from his so long and protracted absence,
               has done the work of a hireling and not of a shepherd, one who, when he sees the wolf
               coming, as the sacred book of the gospels says, "leaveth the sheep and fleeth: and
               the wolf catcheth and scattereth them; and he careth not for the sheep because he is
               an hireling and not the shepherd." Henceforth therefore we also ought no longer to
               wait for a man of such unstable character as his (it is right for us to speak in this
               gentle language), but to settle the things that lie before us on a good basis, and in
               accordance with the purpose of the laws of the Spirit. The same Paul charged the
               God-loving Hilarian bishop of Diocaesarea with having performed an ordination,
               contrary to the holy canons, in a monastery which is not in his jurisdiction; and we
               thought it right to prohibit those who were ordained from exercising the sacred
               ministry until the details of the case should be examined; for the matter was not
               clear but in fact much involved and in need of ex<pb n="87"/>amination and a correct
               decision. But now we have determined it to be right to release the said men from the
               inhibition and to allow them to exercise the ministry, since it is not possible to
               wait any longer fora man who has been absent so unreasonably and in a manner unknown
               to the church ordinances, Therefore your sanctity also, in accordance with the
               conclusion at which we have arrived, must now allow the men to perform priestly
               functions, reserving the examination into the doubt as to the monastery, and as to
               the ordination itself and those to whom the Jurisdiction over this belongs for a
               future season, if the time should invite us to this. </p>
