            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Eusebius the deacon at Apamea.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">from those during episcopacy, from the 7th book the
               218th letter.</head>
            <p> Those who bring you this letter came to us with the information that Libanius the
               devout presbyter, who is enrolled in the holy clergy at Apamea, wishes to exact
               interest from them as arising from a loan of his, contrary to the intention of the
               sacred canons. They say that they often entreated him to extend to them a hand of
               sympathy, and to be content with the amount of the principal only, and they gained
               nothing. Be so good therefore as to remind this man through the religious
               <foreign>oeconomi</foreign>, or stewards, and the devout archdeacon, or chief of
               the deacons, of the divine laws which say, "Thou shalt not exact interest from thy
               brother," and "He giveth not his money upon <pb n="104"/> interest," and "Interest
               and guile departed not from her streets," and things like these. Following in the
               tracks of these texts, the God-clad instructors of the church also forbade interest
               and usury to those who act as priests to God, fixing a fitting punishment and penalty
               for such unjust acquisition. Put him therefore, the aforesaid devout presbyter
               Libanius, in memory of these things, and persuade him to do what beseems him and not
               to do despite either to his own spiritual office, or to God's laws. But let him yield
               to the kinship and consanguinity of nature, lest he call down upon himself the
               severity of the canons. For it is better for him to follow the divine counsel not of
               necessity but of his own will. </p>
