            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same a <foreign>hypomnestikon</foreign> to the
               bishops of Phoenice.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during episcopacy, from the 5th book the
               236th, 237th letter.</head>
            <p> How great account I take of the judgments of God I cannot explain in words. But, to
               speak after the manner of Paul, I call God to witness that I pass the nights without
               sleep, and never cease being worn away by the cares of the days. And I tremble lest I
               administer the business of the apostolic see negligently, and have to bear the
               punishments that my negligence deserves, and be sent to the torments that are for
               ever and do not pass away. When I consider the divine words, spoken beforehand
               through the prophets, I am frightened. and quake, and think I hear God saying,
               "Therefore, shepherds, hear the word of the Lord; <pb n="97"/> thus saith the Lord of
               lords; 'Behold! I am against the shepherds and will require my sheep at their hands,
               and I will cause them to cease from feeding my sheep: and the shepherds shall not
               feed them any more, and will deliver my sheep from their mouth and they shall not
               again serve them for food.'" Thinking upon these words and such as these, and hearing
               God saying over and over again 'my sheep,' I mingle many tears with my thoughts, when
               I remember the religious Epiphanius, who stealthily established himself in the
               Christ-loving metropolis of the Tyrians and stirred up many commotions there, when he
               should have betaken himself to this apostolic see and chosen things pleasing in the
               eyes of peace and done them, and so come back to the said city in brotherly and
               fatherly concord and agreement. Since therefore this duty has been neglected by him,
               and, desiring still even now to correct what has been wrongfully done, we have
               summoned him to us, we wish you to know that he is not allowed to perform any
               ordination until he has come to us and done everything required by law, and so
               yourselves to make a <foreign>psephisma</foreign>, as prescribed in the divine
               canons; and then after that one of those who have been duly selected will be chosen,
               who is able to rule the bishopric blamelessly and in accordance with the judgment of
               God. This also I was desirous of bringing to the knowledge of your holinesses, and I
               charged the religious Thomas and Basil deacons of the apostolic see to have in their
               <pb n="98"/> hands this order in writing, and read it to each of you; that you are
               not to make a <foreign>psephismata</foreign> in company with the said religious
               Epiphanius for the nomination of any bishop, unless all things have first been
               carried out "with decency and with order," as Paul commands us who consecrated the
               Gospel among the nations as he wrote." We have concluded it to be a superfluous task
               to address each of the God-loving bishops, seeing that the urgency of the matter will
               not brook delay. Let no one among you therefore dare to transgress against this our
               warning in writing in any way whatever, knowing that he will incur an accusation of
               presumption and arrogance, and will be laid under bans of excommunication. This is in
               fact the reason why we resolved to send the God-loving Thomas and Basil deacons of
               the apostolic see, because it is our intention and prayer that all things may be
               carried out and performed in order. </p>
