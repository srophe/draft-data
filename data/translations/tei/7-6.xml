            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Stephen bishop of Apamea.</head>
            <head type="sub" resp="#compiler">From those during episcopacy, from. the 1h book the
               106th Letter.</head>
            <p> I have thought it necessary to commend to your love of God the man who brings you
               this letter, and to <pb n="381"/> state the reason for which he has come to you. The
               magnificent and Christ-loving Marinus wrote to me to say that the man is his kinsman,
               and that he is in need of some assistance, as many say; and that by reason of his
               retiring character he would not consent to throw himself into political affairs and
               obtain relief from that source: but he thought it suited to his habits to be included
               among the clergy of the city of the Apamenes: for he is in fact also from that same
               country. Therefore he asked in his letter that this might be carried out for him in
               actual fact. And I after investigating the man's mode of life found, as far as was
               possible for men, that he had not neglected modesty of conduct. But do you also with
               men fitted for this purpose examine the man further, and you will know that he is not
               one unworthy of such a favour. This presupposed, we shall be paying a very just debt
               to the magnificent and Christ-loving Marinus, who concerns himself much about our
               affairs, if we include the man among the clergy of the holy church of the Apamenes,
               and admit him to the order of the diaconate. So much for this matter. As to the
               circumstances of the time, I beg you to remember our humble admonitions, and do all
               things with discretion, and reckon all other things second to the integrity of the
               orthodox faith, in order that you may appear perfect and say like Paul, "I can do all
               things, in Christ which strengtheneth me." <pb n="382"/> The men of the blessed <choice>
                  <reg>ʿAkiba</reg>
                  <orig>'Akiba</orig>
               </choice> have written to me about John the monk, who has betaken himself to a
               temporary retirement with you, to the effect that it was not by their counsel that he
               removed from their monastery, but also that here too he sought to be ordained on his
               own authority (I must use their words); and this they explained not only by their
               letter, but also by sending devout monks here. Accordingly I beg you not to lay a
               daring hand upon him until his archimandrite gives his consent; lest we be found to
               be incurring blame, as breaking the holy ordinances of the churches and of the
               monasteries. </p>
