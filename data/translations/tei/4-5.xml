            <head type="main" resp="#compiler">Of the same to Cosmas archimandrite of the monastery of
               the blessed Cyrus or Khurish.</head>

            <p> We have readily forgiven the devout Julian the sin that was involuntarily committed
               by him. Ignorance and the fact that the man who has sinned confesses this, and in
               consciousness of his fault asks for forgive<pb n="262"/>ness, is a sufficient
               defence. In fact, even when the service of Moses' law prevailed, a man's ignorance,
               or rather the sin arising from this, was not forgiven him on any other condition
               except on his offering the sacrifice for sin: and now also, when the bloodless
               sacrifice has taken its place, and the truth has expelled the shadow, in place of a
               sin-ram, or. a pair of turtledoves or young pigeons, and in place of offering fine
               wheat flour, we have "the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world": only
               if we duly confess the sin. For David also the speaker of divine things somewhere
               says in song, "I said 'I will confess my transgression to the Lord against myself,'
               and thou forgavest the iniquity of my heart." This also you must clearly know: that
               the Lord has forgiven through our meanness not only the man who committed the sin,
               but also all who in ignorance communicated with him. For do not think that the sin
               committed by the brother is less. For a man to associate in communion with heretics
               is grievous, and unpardonable, when the sin is voluntarily committed. For how is it
               anything but shameful that, while we do not consent to eat common sustenance with our
               own enemies, we should eat the heavenly bread which gives life to the world with the
               enemies of God, or that we should communicate with those that are wrongfully
               presented for ordination by them as with holy men, when the Apostle cries, "What
               communion hath light with darkness? or <pb n="263"/> what part hath a believer with
               an unbeliever?", and John the son of thunder writes to the believers, "If any man
               cometh unto you and bringeth not this teaching, receive him not in the house and say
               not to him 'Hail'; for he that saith to him 'Hail' is partaker of his evil deeds."?
               Therefore, these things being so, keep your heart "with all observance," as it is
               written." For that "without faith it is impossible to please" is a declaration of the
               Holy Spirit. </p>
