               237th letter.</head>
            <p> Concerning the unholy woman who in an unhallowed manner thrust herself into the
               degree of the diaconate I both wrote to your magnificence before, and am now again
               writing, though I ascribe the whole affair to an evil demon and to my sins, not to
               you. However, since much contumely is being poured upon me, and for the sake of the
               blamelessness of ecclesiastical order, and to preserve mere holiness itself, the
               object of veneration, I legally placed the hateful and all-presumptuous woman under
               deprivation, stripping her of the supposed office; and she was convicted and even
               herself confessed that she had been married three times, her third husband being
               still alive. Therefore you for your part ought not to have recorded against yourself
               a thing that has been once condoned by me: but you should have been glad and have
               known clearly that we for our part love you sincerely, and hold you in all veneration
               and respect. In another letter also I made known to your greatness that the glorious
               patrician and lieutenant of the Master of the Soldiers? <pb n="126"/> in the East
               excellent in all good qualities has composed a letter to you which has the force of a
               command, in which he gives you leave to support the orthodox and the interests of the
               church with ample freedom and liberty. To speak plainly, in order not to make a long
               story, you have abundant warrant for displaying your qualities against God's enemies. </p>
