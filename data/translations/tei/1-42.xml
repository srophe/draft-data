            <p> Of the circumstances in which we are placed I notified your holinesses before when I
               sent the letter through the holy monastery at Aphthoria. If you have received this
               letter, please let me know this by a missive of your own. <add><emph>And after other
                  things.</emph></add> But Philip, the devout monk from Isauria, who was ordained
               deacon by me, deceived by avaricious thoughts, in truth yielded to some deceivers and
               conceived the idea of digging and bringing up treasure. And he incurred blame from me
               on this account, and was expelled from the chapel of the forty holy martyrs, and was
               ordered to visit himself with labours of repentance. If therefore he is living in the
               holy monastery of father Romanus of holy memory, you are acting rightly in allowing
               him to communicate in the oblation, but excluding him from the deacons' ministry,
               until he shows fruits of repentance for a certain period of time. As to him who holds
               the prelacy of the city of the men of Jerusalem, no news has reached us personally as
               to his reconciliation. But that the man is utterly unstable and weak, seeing that
               from the very beginning he has lived such a confused and inconstant life, and has
               thus been raised to the position that he now holds, all who know <pb n="120"/> him
               are well aware, and I have no need of words on this point. I was glad to see the
               God-loving presbyter father Apaphon, as I said before, and I thought the man's coming
               a great blessing, and you may be sure that I would have bought this at a high price;
               and I have incurred a debt of thanks to Christ our Saviour and God in that I received
               this pleasure for nothing through your saintly prayers. The sum of gold that was
               spent by him upon the well, I mean the sum of fifty darics, we paid to him out of a
               certain God-loving loan. For, believe me, we have not a <foreign>mina</foreign>: and
               this is the only way in which we are relieved in poverty: while in our other pursuits
               we distress God and do nothing at all that is pleasing to Him. </p>
