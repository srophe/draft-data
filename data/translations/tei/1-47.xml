            <p> It is nothing surprising if the prelate of the city of the men of Jerusalem, being
               such in his character and in his faith as everyone knows him to be, but as I for my
               part loathe even to take upon my lips, has done this act also which you have
               mentioned in violation of the holy canons, I mean the act of raising to the bishopric
               a man who was included in <pb n="130"/> the clergy of your holy church. On the
               contrary one ought to have been surprised if one such as he in his faith and in his
               character had done anything canonical and according to regulation. We have told this
               therefore to those who manage our <foreign>apokriseis</foreign> in the royal city. As
               to Agapius the devout bishop, we have this much to say, that, if the offences
               committed by him are of such a nature, this man must be corrected by canonical
               reproofs: with moderation however on account of the difficulty of the time, and
               because the man has now "grown old in evil days," as the sacred scripture says, and
               has already come near to being reckoned with those that are in Hades. For "God is
               faithful, who will not suffer" those that are not rightly disposed towards Him to
               outrage the sacred prelacy for a great length of time, so that through them His name
               should be "blasphemed among the nations," as it is written. </p>
