                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2201">Abgar the great king</persName>
               increased, and it prevailed, and it went up according to its former manner, and
               overflowed and ran out on all sides, so that the courts and the porches and the royal
               houses began to be filled with water. And when our lord <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2201">Abgar the king</persName> saw it, he went up
               to the level ground on the hill above his palace, where dwell and reside those who do
               the work for the government. And while the wise men considered what to do to the
               waters which had so greatly increased, it happened that there was a great and violent
               rain in the night, and the <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/191">Daisan
                  (river)</placeName> came, neither in its day, nor in its month. And strange waters
               came; and they encountered the <hi rend="italic">cataracts</hi> (? flood gates) which
               were fastened with great pieces of iron which were overlaid upon them, and with bars
               of iron which supported them. But not prevailing against them, the waters rose like a
               great sea beyond the walls of the city. And the waters began to come down from the
               apertures of the wall into the city. And <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2201">Abgar the king</persName> stood on the great
               tower which was called that of the Persians, and saw the water by the light of
               torches, and he commanded, and they took away the gates and the eight <hi
                  rend="italic">cataracts</hi>(? flood-gates) of the western wall of the city where
               the river flowed out. But that very hour the waters broke down the western wall of
               the city, and entered the city, and overthrew the great and beautiful palace of our
               lord the king, and they carried away everything that was found before them, the
               desirable and beautiful edifices of the city, whatever was near the river on the
               south and on the north of it. And they destroyed <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2580">the temple of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2588">the church of the
               Christians</placeName></placeName>. And there were killed by that occurrence more than two thousand men, upon
               many of whom as they slept in the night the waters came suddenly, and they were
               drowned, and the city was filled with the sound of lamentation.</p>
            <p>And when <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2201">Abgar the king</persName> saw
               this destruction which had befallen, he commanded that all the craftsmen of the city
               should remove their cottages (or huts) from near the river, and that no man should
               build near the river any cottage. And by the wisdom of measurers and men of skill the
               cottages were placed so that the breadth of the river might be increased, and they
               added to its former measure. For if the waters were many and strong, the width of the
               river was too small to receive the water of twenty-five brooks with what they
               gathered from all sides. And <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2201">Abgar the
                  king</persName> commanded that all who lived in the porch, and were occupied over
               against the river, from Tishrin the former to Nisan (October to April)<!-- Is this a specific year, i.e. 514 AG (AD 202-203). Or was this an annual decree to prevent another flood without having a warning system in place and people in harm's way? -->, should not
               lodge in their cottages, except the islanders (Gazireans) who kept the city, five of
               whom should lodge on the wall above the place where the waters entered the city all
               the time of winter, and when they perceived by night and heard the sound of strange

               despised the command of the king. And this commandment was decreed from this time
               wherein it was so to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Our lord <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2201">Abgar the king</persName>
               commanded, and there was built for him a building for <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2583">his royal house--a winter house</placeName>
               at <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2584">Tabara</placeName>--and there he dwelt all the time of winter; and in
               summer he came down to <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2587">the new palace</placeName> which was built for him at the fountain head.
               And his nobles also built for themselves buildings to live in, in the neighbourhood
               in which the king was, in the high street (?) which is called <placeName>Beth
                  Saharoye</placeName><!-- URI? The term means "Lunar House" -->. And in order to restore the welfare of the former city,
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2201">Abgar the king</persName>
               commanded, and the tributes due from those within, and from those who dwelt in towns,
               and in hamlets, were remitted: and tribute was not demanded from them for five years,
               until the city was enriched with men, and was crowned with buildings.</p>

                  &quot;An.&quot; where the text has &quot;the year,&quot; or &quot;in the year;&quot;
                  and we have not always explained the month. The year A.D. may of course be
                  ascertained by deducting 311; care being taken to remember that the years properly
                  commence in September<!--SPEAR, which I've been following, has the year commencing in October. Not sure how to mark the following dates in light of that...-->. Hence Haziran 636 is A.D. 325; but so is Canun the former 637.
                  Therefore, when an occurrence falls in the first eight months of the year we must
                  deduct 311 to reduce it to A.D.; but when an event belongs to the four last months we
                  must deduct 312. There are irregularities, but the year properly began on the Calends
                  of September. For the benefit of some readers we append the months which generally
                  correspond. At present the Persian Nestorians follow the old style, like the
                  Russians, but we may regard the ancient months as agreeing with the Roman:---- <table

               bishops <date notBefore="0313" notAfter="0769" calendar="#Gregorian">from A.D. 313 to 769</date>. We may note that the Chronicle mentions no Bishop of

                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2247">Conon</persName>, &quot;who laid the

                  >Edessa</placeName></placeName>&quot; in <date when="0313" calendar="#Gregorian">A.D. 313</date>. But we must not misinterpret this
               indication. There had long been Christians in <placeName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/place/78">Edessa</placeName>, as authentic records prove.
               Not only so, this very Chronicle, in recording the overthrow of the city by water in
                  <choice><reg resp="Cowper"><date notBefore="0201-10" notAfter="0202-09" calendar="#Gregorian">A.D. 201/2</date></reg><orig><date when-custom="0513" datingMethod="#Seleucid">513</date></orig></choice>, mentions the destruction of the
               &quot;<placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2580">temple of <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2588">the church of the Christians</placeName></placeName>.&quot; This remarkable phrase shews not
               only that the disciples had a house of worship then, but that it was called a temple.
               More than this, the Christian community seems to monopolize the word Church, which
               was not yet applied to the building in which they assembled. <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/349">Assemani</persName> observes that the words
               under notice shew that the Archivists were still heathen, although the king was a
               Christian, as <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/480">Eusebius</persName> notes from <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/840">Africanus</persName> (in Chron).
                  <persName ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2247">Conon</persName>, above-named,
               refounded <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2588">the church at <placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/78"
                  >Edessa</placeName></placeName>, and hoped to rebuild it, but this work was accomplished by
               his successor. It can hardly be supposed that the reference is to the restoration of
               the &quot;temple&quot; destroyed in <date when="0202" calendar="#Gregorian">A.D. 202</date>; it is rather to what is called
               &quot;<placeName ref="http://syriaca.org/place/2588">the old church</placeName>&quot; in number 60; restored by <persName
                  ref="http://syriaca.org/person/2268">Justinian</persName> with immense
