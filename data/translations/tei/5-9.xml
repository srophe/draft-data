            <p> Joyfully I have received the greeting of your love of God, which refreshed me
               greatly even before reading it because even in its mere superscription only it bore
               your honoured name. And after other things. Since therefore the sacred text says of
               kings who act in this spiritual mind that "by patience kings prosper," it beseems
               your statesmanship, and is very consonant to it, with patience and in very great
               humility readily to receive those who wish to come to the orthodox faith and share
               with you in the same struggles, and to go forward to meet them and embrace and
               welcome them readily, so that the word of truth also may go on in the right way and
               make progress. It has in fact come to the hearing of our meanness that the flock of
               Simeon who has the lot: of the saints have repudiated the impiety in writing, and <pb
                  n="324"/> have stripped themselves for the same stadium as you, and that your
               sanctity used some strict words that are not suited to the present time: and I am
               astonished and cannot believe that this mind is yours. It was in fact you that they
               imitated because they are settled in your neighbourhood, and it was you who brought
               about this change for the better in them. </p>
